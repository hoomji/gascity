"""M4 checkpointed backfill, debounced collection and the classification queue.

The collector is a separate, bounded process. Agents never wait on it: it reads
explicit transcript roots, imports what changed into the projection, and queues
changed sessions for a later, budgeted classification drain. Nothing here is
consulted by dispatch or routing.

Guarantees:

* **Every scoped source has a status and a reason.** Each discovered file,
  unsupported provider file, unlistable directory and vanished source is kept
  in ``collector_sources`` with one of :data:`SOURCE_STATUSES`. Files no
  adapter recognizes (locks, notes, sidecars) are counted per run by suffix in
  ``ignored_files`` rather than dropped silently.
* **Checkpoints make replay safe.** A source is re-read only when its stat
  changes; imports go through the idempotent store import, so a crash between
  import and checkpoint re-imports as duplicates and counts are preserved.
* **Bounded runs.** Per-run source/byte caps and a projection size cap defer
  work (``deferred`` with a reason) rather than dropping it. At least one
  changed source makes progress per run, so a byte cap cannot wedge the
  backlog; a per-source cap keeps files too large to parse in memory out
  entirely, visible as ``deferred``. A source deferred because of its own size
  is retried only when its stat changes (or the cap is raised), so an oversized
  compressed stream is not re-decompressed on every pass.
* **Debounce.** A file modified within ``debounce_seconds`` is still being
  written; it is ``debounced`` and picked up on a later run. A file that never
  goes quiet is read anyway once ``max_debounce_seconds`` have passed since its
  pending change was first seen; the adapters hold back a partial trailing line,
  so a live transcript is collected incrementally. A replacement or truncation
  at the same path is a *new* change and starts a fresh clock, so an expired
  clock is never inherited by a file written moments ago.
* **Kill switch.** When the switch file exists (or the environment variable
  :data:`KILL_SWITCH_ENV` is ``1``) collection and draining stop without
  touching the city.
* **The unknown queue.** A session whose classification keeps failing ends in
  ``unknown`` with its last failure, never as a fabricated label. Budget
  exhaustion, an open circuit and credential/model refusals leave items
  ``pending`` and stop the drain instead of burning attempts.

The default classification state is **metadata only** (event kinds, tool names,
command categories, models, duration). No transcript text, titles or command
lines are sent. Text is a separate, explicit data scope: ``queue-drain
--text-state`` opts in, and the text state is redacted, excerpted to the
transport byte cap, and stored under a text-namespaced subject snapshot.
