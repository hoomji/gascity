"""Machine-built "silver" reference labels without human annotation.

The measurement plan's gold gate historically required hand labelling. This
module replaces that with a **silver** reference built from independent judge
models (GLM 5.3 Flash and DeepSeek V4 Flash through the Uniblock prod gateway,
optionally joined by subscription-backed judges such as GPT 6 Luna and Gemini
3.8 Flash):

* candidate episodes are sampled deterministically, stratified by provider;
* each judge labels ``primary_intent`` from the *same stripped transcript text*
  with the *same taxonomy criteria* at temperature 0 and JSON output;
* agreeing judges produce an ``adjudicated`` label; a disagreement produces
  ``disagreement`` and is excluded from the primary score and reported;
* judge-judge Cohen's kappa gates trust: below :data:`KAPPA_TRUST_FLOOR` the
  silver set is reported as untrustworthy and the gate is not claimed. A sample
  below :data:`MIN_SILVER_SAMPLE_SIZE` episodes is untrusted regardless of kappa
  because kappa over a tiny sample is degenerate.

The judge set is configurable and each judge is bound to a pluggable
**backend** (``gateway`` OpenAI-compatible HTTP, or the ``codex-cli`` /
``agy-cli`` subscription CLIs). The default remains the two gateway judges, so
the historical two-judge result is unchanged. With more than two judges the
report adds every pairwise Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa across all judges, each
judge's label distribution, and Jev accuracy/macro-F1 against each judge, the
majority label and the unanimous label.

Silver is a *reference*, not ground truth: it measures agreement between LLMs.
A Jev error shared by the judges is invisible. The limitation is recorded in
the report and in the README.

Everything here is deterministic given the same candidates, text and recorded
judge answers; the HTTP client and the CLI backends are the only network paths
and are never used by tests.
